    "During this project, we will:  \n",
    "\n",
    "        - Build and tune three machine learning models: An XGBoost, a Random Forest, and an SVM to predict a given target.  \n",
    "        - Show the log loss and accuracy for XGBoost and Random Forest models on out of fold predictions. Show the Accuracy of the SVM on a validation set.\n",
    "        - Time how long it takes to do a sample of 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000 rows in the SVM and report the rough scaling of SVM with the sample sizes.  \n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As a global specialist in personal insurance, BNP Paribas Cardif serves 90 million clients in 36 countries across Europe, Asia and Latin America.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world shaped by the emergence of new uses and lifestyles, everything is going faster and faster. When facing unexpected events, customers expect their insurer to support them as soon as possible. However, claims management may require different levels of check before a claim can be approved and a payment can be made. With the new practices and behaviors generated by the digital economy, this process needs adaptation thanks to data science to meet the new needs and expectations of customers.\n",

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team has been given an anonymized dataset containing both categorical and numeric variables available form the following site:  \n",
    "\n",
    "https://smu.box.com/s/bizpcq4a3dtid04tke1x7nz7359r79y5  \n",
    "\n",
    "The original size of the data set is 114321 rows and 133 columns.\n",
    "There is no missing data, no metadata, no ordinal variables or a data dictionary.  \n",
    "The \"target\" column in the set is the variable to predict. It is equal to 1 for claims suitable for an accelerated approval.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Methods and Results  \n",
    "To predict the category of a claim based on features available early in the process we will build 3 tuned models; XGBoost, Random Forest and SVM. We will show the log loss and accuracy for XGBoost, and Random Forest models on out of fold predictions, show the Accuracy of the SVM on a validation set and finaly we will time how long it takes to do a sample of 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000 rows in the SVM.  With the data collected during this project we will also be able to provide a rough scaling of SVM with sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create the train and test set for cross-validation of the results using the train_test_split function from sklearn's model_selection module with test_size size equal to 30% of the data. Also, to maintain the reproducibility of the results, a random_state of 123 will be assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In so doing we will be helping BNP Paribas Cardif accelerate its claims process and therefore provide a better service to its customers.      \n",
    "\n",
    "*The code used throughout the project is original to this team and modified versions of samples provided during class.*"
